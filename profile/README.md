## 🏭 About this organization

> `aOSE` is a **personal project**, which _I want to expand this vision to other interested parties_, so that they can
> contribute to it! 😄

### 💡 An overview

**The concept of this project was conceived after a time of analysis and engagement on may part, Vitor Costa, about
my own studies in the area of _Software Engineering_ ⚙️ during my training**. Of course, when I started, **there was a strong
incentive in the "programming" niche during and after the COVID-19 pandemic ☣️** -- _an effect that sill persists, even if
slightly, today_. **So, I myself studied with bias that the programmer's diffrential is: knowing several technologies,
writing good code and... it ended there**. 🤔
But over time, _while this phenomenon lost strength_, I began to reevaluate the concepts I was taking to define a
programmer and, better, open my eyes to stages in software development that I was blind to 👨‍🦯‍➡️: such as _business modeling
and analysis_ 🧑‍💼, _system design_ 📋, _software architecture_ 📐 and so on (**among other disciplines that are in
[SWEBOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Engineering_Body_of_Knowledge)**). 🤯

Of course, **I don't leave out other computing content that isn't so "traditional" in this programming bubble,
concpets that are fundamental, but treated in a marginal way**, such as: _algorithm design and analysis_ 🧮, _graph theory_ 🕸️,
_computer architecture_ 🖥️ and so on. Overall, we see that what is presented in a generic way about computing is **DSA**
(_data structures and algorithms_), **but there is a much broader ocean of knowledge** ⛵.

> When you have contact with the [**_Halting Problem_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem#:~:text=In%20computability%20theory%2C%20the%20halting,or%20continue%20to%20run%20forever.), _you view of computing changes radically_. 🔥

### 🚀 The purpose

_Resuming... so, what would be the purpose of `aOSE`? And by the way, what does `aOSE` mean?_ 🤔

**Starting with the last question**: let's digress a little about the brand; from what has already been said,
`'Software Engineering'` has already become clear about what I mean: **it refers to the discipline of Computing that
applies engineering principles to software development, okay** ⚙️. _But I think it may be curious to use `'Ordinary'` and,
in my view, the use of the indefinite article `'An'` is even more so_. **What do I mean by that? _In essence, it is to
convey the symbolic idea that simple and well-done work overcomes, par excellence, the complex workload_** 🧠.
It's `'Ordinary'`  **because it's within the reach of every analyst, developer, designer, or architect: the principles
are known, you just have to evaluate how to apply them and how pertinent they are to a given project or even a
decision to be made. It is doing the work with will, with surrender of oneself, without laziness...**
And it is `'An'`, **for many others have already done more than -- and I lean on their efforts
(as Newton would say, "stand on the shoulders of giants") --, as well as all those who
will come after me. Software Engineering and Computing will continue to evolve constantly (and I hope so),
but what we do are way to do so? let`s continue to evaluate the consistency of our processes, of our modeling**.

**Finally, the first question**: the **purpose** of `aOSE` **is more than talking about software or writing code** 📝. _Our
intention is to involve the entire cycle of a project, about the life cycle of a software and the reasons for its death_.
We'll talk about how a processor works or how low-level threads are created... That is, everything that makes us think,
in fact, about why we write code! 🧐
