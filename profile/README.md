## 🏭 About this organization

> `aOSE` is a personal project, which I want to expand this vision to other interested parties, so that they can
> contribute to it!

### 💡 An overview

The concept of this project was conceived after a time of analysis and engagement on may part, Vitor Costa, about
my own studies in the area of Software Engineering during my training. Of course, when I started, there was a strong
incentive in the "programming" niche during and after the COVID-19 pandemic -- an effect that sill persists, even if
slightly, today. So, I myself studied with bias that the programmer's diffrential is: knowing several technologies,
writing good code and... it ended there.
But over time, while this phenomenon lost strength, I began to reevaluate the concepts I was taking to define a
programmer and, better, open my eyes to stages in software development that I was blind to: such as business modeling
and analysis, system design, software architecture and so on (among other disciplines that are in
[SWEBOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Engineering_Body_of_Knowledge)).

Of course, I don't leave out other computing content that isn't so "traditional" in this programming bubble,
concpets that are fundamental, but treated in a marginal way, such as: algorithm design and analysis, graph theory,
computer architecture and so on. Overall, we see that what is presented in a generic way about computing is DSA
(data structures and algorithms), but there is a much broader ocean of knowledge.

> When you have contact with the Halting Problem, you view of computing changes radically.

### 🚀 The purpose

Resuming... so, what would be the purpose of `aOSE`? And by the way, what does `aOSE` mean?

Starting with the last question: let's digress a little about the brand; from what has already been said,
'Software Engineering' has already become clear about what I mean: it refers to the discipline of Computing that
applies engineering principles to software development, okay. But I think it may be curious to use 'Ordinary' and,
in my view, the use of the indefinite article 'An' is even more so. What do I mean by that? In essence, it is to
convey the symbolic idea that simple and well-done work overcomes, par excellence, the complex workload.
It's 'Ordinary' because it's within the reach of every analyst, developer, designer, or architect: the principles
are known, you just have to evaluate how to apply them and how pertinent they are to a given project or even a
decision to be made. It is doing the work with will, with surrender of oneself, without laziness...
And it is 'An', for many others have already done more than -- and I lean on their efforts
(as Newton would say, "stand on the shoulders of giants") --, as well as all those who
will come after me. Software Engineering and Computing will continue to evolve constantly (and I hope so),
but what we do are way to do so? let`s continue to evaluate the consistency of our processes, of our modeling.

Finally, the first question: the purpose of `aOSE` is more than talking about software or writing code. Our intention is to involve the entire cycle of a project, about the life cycle of a software and the reasons for its death. We'll talk about how a processor works or how low-level threads are created... That is, everything that makes us think, in fact, about why we write code!
